# LAP2-blogposting













## Wins & Challenges
### Wins
* All requirements in the brief were met.
* Users can see other people's comments on all posts.


### Challenges
* Had to go through a lot of trial and error to get the post method to work for the entries and relevant comments to that entry.
* Tests for the front end weren't initially being recognised by jest.
* Many elements were being created dynamically within a fetch which made accessing the elements difficult.
* Difficult to test front end for async functions and event listeners
